Games/Cryptoquote version 1.30
==============================

This module solves cryptoquote puzzles.  Cryptoquotes
(sometimes called cryptogram) are typically brief
famous quotes, enciphered such that every letter stands
for another letter.  For example, "Xrxb" stands for "Adam".

Note that you'll get some pretty interesting results if
your cryptoquote puzzle does not yield a unique result,
or if it uses words that are not in your dictionary.

Thanks to Adam Foxson <afoxson@pobox.com> for making this
CPANable and numerous other cleanups.
